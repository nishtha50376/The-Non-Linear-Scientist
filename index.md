title: The Non-Linear Scientist

## Welcome to The Non-Linear Scientist

I’m a researcher and consultant working at the intersection of **optics**, **integrated photonics (Si/III-V materials)**, **RF/mm-wave technologies**, and **cleanroom fabrication**.
This site is where I translate complex science into engaging, nature-inspired analogies and share my journey, highlighting the **point-of-view** as seen from academic, industrial, and societal perspective.

## Featured Insight: Can Light Think?

<img src="assets/images/brain-wavefront.jpg" alt="Brain-like Optical Processing" width="70%">

In neuromorphic computing, we model how neurons process inputs through **timing, connection strength, and feedback**.

But what if **light** could do the same?

Optical systems — especially those that modulate **phase and amplitude** — are increasingly being designed to **compute**, not just transmit. Light waves can **interfere, resonate, and converge** much like **neural impulses** in the brain.

🧬 In a photonic neural network, a wavefront might carry encoded information in **its shape, angle, or even its distortion** — just like a neuron encodes meaning in its spike train.

These systems don’t just move fast. They move **differently** — embracing **non-linearity**, **parallelism**, and even **memory** in ways that echo the brain.
