## Optical systems & photonics R&D

I’m an optical engineer and researcher working across optics, integrated photonics (Si/III–V), RF/mm-wave technologies, and prototyping/characterisation workflows. I build prototypes, design test strategy, and translate complex physics into clear engineering decisions.

## Featured insight: Can light compute?

Neuromorphic computing asks how information can be processed through timing, connection strength, and feedback.

Photonic systems can exhibit analogous behaviour. When we control phase and amplitude, light can interfere, resonate, and transform wavefronts in ways that enable computation-like operations — not just transmission.

If you’re curious, I’m building short explainers with lightweight simulations and visual intuition.
